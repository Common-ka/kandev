# Task 05: Executor binding and explicit adoption

## Summary

The [navigation follow-up](../ssh-connections-executor-navigation/plan.md) owns
the completed contextual manager return and draft-preservation refinement. This
order retains backend binding/adoption acceptance and its current status.

Connect the new manager to real SSH task execution and make legacy adoption explicit. Bound executor settings cannot substitute another target or identity.

## In scope

- Wire the resolver into preparation/launch/readiness/status/resume/cleanup; retain the complete route stamp and both identity generations. Validate dependency revisions before remote effects; reject direct fallback.
- Implement atomic profile binding/adoption against current revision/config digest, target-change conflicts, reference deletion protections, and managed-selector enforcement in legacy HTTP/WS routes.
- Add executor selector/adoption UI and auth tests; recheck #3783 and migrate its consumers if it has landed without implementing that runtime here.

## Out of scope

Production work outside this order, remote Docker runtime implementation, and
changes to the confirmed credential ownership boundary. No publishing or delegation.

## Acceptance

- Two profiles reuse one connection; auth readiness and executor readiness stay distinct, and non-admin task use cannot override credentials or target.
- Legacy direct and single-hop adoption retains the exact target/pin, resolves each hop identity, and requires explicit bastion trust; failed route checks leave the profile unchanged. Refuse transport edits while retained runtimes depend on either route record; stale recorded generations never reconnect to a changed target.
- Enabled/disabled and HTTP/WS/runtime paths obey the same gate and authority, including background probes and authenticated task use.

## ASCII UI preview

[Combined previews](plan.md#ascii-ui-preview). Applicable ACs are listed above;
retain the same structure and state rules in the rendered result.

### UI-04: Executor binding

Entry: SSH executor editor, shared composition with phone picker Drawer.

```text
Connection [Build box: Ready v]     [Manage connections]
Connection: Ready | Agent readiness: Not checked
[Test executor]
Shared Save changes: disabled until executor check succeeds

Legacy profile
Connection: Existing inline SSH settings
[Move to shared connection]
Preview: destination + optional bastion, each user/identity/fingerprint
[Create connection and check]
```

Maps to 002.4-002.8, 004.5, and 005.1-005.2. Converted forms cannot override the
connection target or pin. Conflicting edits keep current server data and show a
reload/retry action. Single-hop adoption adds explicit bastion trust and route
checks; unsupported chained settings leave the legacy editor untouched.

Structural requirements are control order, explicit trust before credential
use at each hop, focused phone navigation, and a distinct recovery state. Labels and spacing
are illustrative and must be localized. Reuse SettingsLayoutClient's single
scroll owner and save bar. Phone/coarse targets are >=44px; desktop controls
are 28px. Safe-area/keyboard space keeps the current action reachable; no
horizontal document scroll. Test around 767/768px and on a coarse tablet.


## Verification

Use TDD for changed logic. Commands below are run from the repository root;
read the [prerequisites](plan.md#verification-prerequisites) first. Tests named
in this package are created by their owning order, not claimed to exist today.

```bash
(cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/sshconnections ./internal/ssh ./internal/task/service ./internal/task/handlers -count=1)
(cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle -run 'Test(ManagedSSH|ConnectionReady|SSH|BuildAuth|IdentityAgent)' -count=1)
(cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/backendapp -run 'Test(SSHConnections|ManagedSelectors)' -count=1)
(cd apps/web && pnpm exec vitest run components/settings/ssh-connections/managed-binding.test.tsx components/settings/ssh-connection-card.test.tsx)
(cd apps/web && pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run i18n:check)

## Dependencies

Task 04; see the [manifest](plan.md#work-orders).

## Risks

Connection edits and task admission race across network calls. Recheck revision before workload effects and protect references transactionally. Do not treat management scope as workspace reach.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- [Requirements](../../specs/executors/requirements/ssh-connection-manager.md), IDs above.
- [System design](../../specs/executors/system-design/ssh-connection-manager.md), corresponding sections.
- [Custody ADR](../../decisions/2026-09-19-managed-ssh-credential-custody.md).
- Existing source seams, test cases, and fixtures identified in the manifest and design.

## Results

Recovery resumed on 2026-10-20 under the preserved implementation approval.

Managed executor binding/adoption, saved route stamps, runtime recovery references, and reachability integration restored and reconciled with current ownership/save coordination. Targeted tests pass. Real OpenSSH direct and bastion adoption now preserves the target and pin, refuses unverified or stale configuration changes, and authenticates after restart. Managed executor launch/reconnect and the legacy launch/recovery cases also have fresh container evidence. The complete browser adoption matrix, dependency details for refused deletion, and current-main orphan-sweep integration for managed connections remain open.

See [recovery provenance](recovery/recovery.md) and
[current validation](recovery/validation.md). Historical test reports are not
current acceptance. This work order is not complete.
