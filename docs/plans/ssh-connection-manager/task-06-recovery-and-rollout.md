# Task 06: Restart and disabled-path integration

## Summary

Complete the cross-process recovery and rollout contract with executable real-host evidence and operator documentation. This is the final feature integration slice, not an extra generic QA phase.

## In scope

- Add real managed direct/single-hop runtime restart/no-agent and missing-key recovery tests, including retained bastion pin/identity and dependent-route conflicts; interrupted enrollment must remain unknown and never replay.
- Complete off-state route/direct-call/runtime coverage, feature registry contract checks, and all final changed-path checks.
- Update public executor how-to and secret protection/recovery reference alongside behavior, backend scoped guidance for new ownership, and spec statuses only after actual implementation passes.

## Out of scope

Production work outside this order, remote Docker runtime implementation, and
changes to the confirmed credential ownership boundary. No publishing or delegation.

## Acceptance

- A managed task reconnects after backend restart without an inherited agent; key loss, pin changes, and connection revision conflicts fail before remote workload action.
- Disabled paths retain data, refuse managed remote actions/decryption, and preserve legacy behavior; browser and runtime evidence agree.
- Public docs explain bootstrap prerequisites, backup custody, deletion versus revocation, feature enable/restart, manual-copy fallback, and compatibility limits; final evidence records all required checks without counting skips as passes.

## Verification

Use TDD for changed logic. Commands below are run from the repository root;
read the [prerequisites](plan.md#verification-prerequisites) first. Tests named
in this package are created by their owning order, not claimed to exist today.

## Dependencies

Task 05; see the [manifest](plan.md#work-orders).

## Risks

Use disposable backend state, master keys, and SSH hosts only. Test authoring must not delete a real protection key. No new gate promotion, publication, or automatic GitHub actions are included.

## Parallelism

`sequential`

## Inputs

- [Requirements](../../specs/executors/requirements/ssh-connection-manager.md), IDs above.
- [System design](../../specs/executors/system-design/ssh-connection-manager.md), corresponding sections.
- [Custody ADR](../../decisions/2026-09-19-managed-ssh-credential-custody.md).
- Existing source seams, test cases, and fixtures identified in the manifest and design.

## Results

Recovery resumed on 2026-10-20 under the preserved implementation approval.

Recovery hooks, default-off gates, settings gates, and public documentation are restored. A fresh process reopens the database/vault and authenticates retained direct and bastion snapshots without SSH agent variables. Missing ciphertext and a different protection key fail before authentication without identity replacement. Authenticated browser coverage verifies administrator access and member rejection before management actions. A rebuilt real OpenSSH test now proves managed workload launch and backend restart without an inherited SSH agent, including health through the restored tunnel. That test exposed and verified a fix for startup recovery bypassing the managed resolver. The new Go regression checks valid, missing-stamp, stale-generation, and disabled cases without legacy fallback. Desktop-specific acceptance and the full failure matrix remain open.

See [recovery provenance](recovery/recovery.md) and
[current validation](recovery/validation.md). Historical test reports are not
current acceptance. This work order is not complete.
