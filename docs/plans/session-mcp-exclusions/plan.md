# Implementation Plan: Session MCP Exclusions

## Overview

Allow an existing task agent session to exclude inherited catalog definitions
and restore inheritance. Implement the saved contract and resolver first,
prove lifecycle acceptance second, then expose the desktop and phone controls.
Implementation was authorized by the user on 2026-10-23.

The [requirements](../../specs/agents/requirements/session-mcp-exclusions.md)
and [design](../../specs/agents/system-design/session-mcp-exclusions.md) define
the implementation contract.

## Baseline and coordination

- Task: `15641d1a-d7ba-4216-aefd-5a4c36a88d73`.
- Workspace: `/home/zeval/.kandev/tasks/allow-session-only-i_ae4fhzed/pr3293-followup-source-20261022`.
- Feature branch: `feature/allow-session-only-i-2gn`.
- Fetched parent and initial clean HEAD: `193de56ba2597b335a97b1e5ab01d09340f22647`.
- Integrated assignment WO01: `f9137074309bebe99e2c7576baefe936bc20358f`.
- User agreed to stack on assignment. Planned PR target:
  `feature/clarify-mcp-assignme-mhh`. The original parent branch stays unchanged.

The parent merged as `0b81ae48d4e2c358f80ac489e39388dfd8d7e6ab`. The local
stack now includes that squash through the rebased assignment branch. Keep the
PR target on assignment while it is unmerged; after assignment merges, reconcile
its actual merge and retarget to main without replaying dependency commits. No merge is authorized. Preserve other edits and
commits. Do not change the parent branch or sibling workspaces. No extra agents,
tasks, sessions, or autopilot are authorized.

Read sibling saved plans for interface alignment: management clarity
`000d477e-f792-4c9d-8503-50ed73bb9646`, registration assignment
`5a8cb5cd-22ee-42e5-bd6d-e2179e899c8c`, and built-in management
`6d1b4323-e821-4599-acea-07273a60dd78`. Registration assignment work order 01,
`docs/plans/mcp-assignment-after-registration/task-01-guard-selection-replacement.md`,
is the committed implementation prerequisite for local work order 01. It owns
conditional replacement, session revision admission, exact committed responses,
consistent GET snapshots, locks, and conflict/retry semantics. This package
extends that primitive for exclusions. Assignment work orders 02/03 and the
other siblings are not prerequisites. Never copy sibling uncommitted code.
Omitted exclusion fields preserve saved exclusions in additive writes.

## Scope

### In scope

- Session-owned persistence, atomic writes, validation, and reversible suppression.
- Origins from all repositories/profile/task/session, disabled and dormant cases.
- Desired/accepted comparison and existing safe idle/next-start application.
- Existing-session Customize actions, phone parity, localization, and focused tests.
- User documentation and activation of the narrow parent-contract exception.

### Out of scope

- Upstream exclusions, creation-time exclusions, and per-definition overrides.
- Built-in/tool management, native provider config editing, or forced revocation.
- Catalog usage navigation, profile management, and registration assignment.
- New reconnect protocols, automatic restarts, probes, and broad verification suites.

## Assumption check

Confirmed: only one session changes, origins stay visible, reversal is required,
active turns remain immutable, and built-in management belongs to a sibling.

Verified: the parent resolver unions positive IDs. Accepted snapshots and
provider-aware application already exist. The original session handler lacked client CAS; assignment WO01 supplies it.
The session body is reused during creation and needs explicit exclusion authority.

Design choices: exclusions last for the session identity until restored. Dormant
exclusions persist. Required Kandev capabilities remain outside the control.
These choices were in the completed package before the later implementation
request. No material design decision remains unresolved.

## Technical approach

### Saved state and effective composition

Extend `internal/agent/mcpconfig` and `internal/agent/settings/store` with the
session exclusion relation. Read and write it atomically with desired revision
and positive session IDs. Reuse the assignment primitive's session
`selection_revision` / `expected_revision`, mapped to existing desired revision,
for exclusion-aware writes. Do not introduce a second counter or session
membership precondition. Non-session membership CAS remains assignment-owned.
This explicitly supersedes the crossed `expected_excluded_definition_ids`
proposal and whichever-lands-first ordering. Session ID-set preconditions are
rejected; assignment work order 01 remains the single primitive owner.
Old additions-only writes preserve E under the same store lock.

Extend `mcp_selection_handlers.go` and the session response. Keep other scopes
additive. Extend the consistent `ReadMCPResolutionInputs` snapshot, subtract by
ID before secret resolution, and generate `session_excluded` decisions without
removing origins. Share the post-exclusion setup builder with comparison.

Session cleanup needs a narrow subscription to the existing `events.SessionRemoved`
in `registerMCPDeletionCleanup` and a settings-store session cleanup operation.
Task/workspace/definition cleanup must also handle exclusion-only sessions.

### Delivery acceptance

Retain the prepared-operation boundary and existing accepted-setup persistence.
Exercise startup, resume/load, reset, actual restart, rebind, and live adoption
with excluded definitions. Keep snapshot version 1 and extend comparison's
saved-identity guard with exclusion IDs. A failed operation retains the accepted
baseline without claiming runtime rollback.

| Delivery path | Exclusion behavior | Focused evidence | Fallback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ACP with eligible resume/load | Complete post-exclusion set at idle | Lifecycle fake client captures exact RPC and revision | Failed state retains baseline and retry |
| ACP without advertised support | Save E, no reconnect | Unsupported reconnect test | Next actual start |
| ACP with project MCP strategy | No same-process file-reload claim | Project reconnect test | Next actual start |
| Local/SSH passthrough | Prepare post-exclusion set on actual start | Existing passthrough operation tests | Save deferred state while running |
| Retained process adoption | Preserve current delivered setup | Acceptance/adoption guard regression | Pending choice remains until eligible application |
| Native provider or synthetic legacy configuration | No new catalog removal guarantee | Legacy alias and eligibility regression | Explain control's catalog-only scope |

Provider names do not establish reconnect support. Mock transport evidence does
not certify a live provider connection. No container suite is required for the
unchanged executor contract. A changed executor boundary needs a revised work order.

### Presentation

Extend the shared session controller, typed API, and origin rows. Exclusion
authority is an explicit existing-session capability, not `sessionPresentation`.
Keep connections, pending status, and configuration eligibility separate.
Use existing dialog/drawer primitives and shared Save ownership elsewhere.

Required structure: fixed header/view controls, one body scroller, unchanged row
order, all origins, explicit action labels, and pending actions before choices.
Phone actions measure at least 44 by 44px. Desktop ordinary actions measure
28px high. The current-setup line requires a matching known comparison. Text,
spacing, example names, and exact decoration are illustrative and localized.

UI-03: Material row and application states (inside the same body).

```text
Excluded + workspace disabled:
  Saved: excluded. Definition disabled for this workspace.
  [Restore inheritance]  Restoring will not enable the definition.
Dormant:
  Saved exclusions / Atlas Docs / No longer inherited
  [Restore inheritance]  Does not add a server.
Failed application:
  Saved change could not be confirmed. Last accepted setup retained.
  [Retry]  Or apply on the next agent start.
Conflict/rejection:
  Saved choices changed elsewhere / Could not save.
  Authoritative choices remain visible. Repeat the edit after refresh.
Unknown comparison:
  Saved: excluded. Exact changes cannot be compared yet.
Empty inheritance:
  No inherited servers. Additional servers remain available.
Initial load / refresh:
  Loading on first read only. Refresh keeps existing rows and focus.
```

UI-01/02/03 cover AC-003.1 through .5 and AC-002.4/.5. The required built-in
explanation is passive text, not a new built-in management row.

## Tests

All new test names below are planned tests, not existing coverage. Use TDD after
the implementation request. Existing neighboring tests are regression inputs.

| Acceptance criteria | Planned test and evidence |
| --- | --- |
| AC-001.1/.2 | `session_exclusions_test.go`: `TestSessionMCPExclusionsUnion` covers duplicate contributors, all repositories, session overlap, and sibling isolation |
| AC-001.3/.4/.5 | Store `mcp_session_exclusions_test.go`: `TestSessionMCPExclusionsPersistence` covers replay, reopen, dormant/disabled state, delete/recreate, session/workspace cleanup |
| AC-001.6 | Store and handler `TestSessionMCPExclusionsConflict`/`Authorization` cover stale revision, lost response recovery, mixed-client writers, exclusion-only revision advance, same-set Retry, rejected payload, and omitted-field compatibility |
| AC-001.7, AC-002.6 | Resolver `TestSessionMCPExclusionsDelivery` covers secret lookup suppression, no executable entry, reserved/synthetic targets, legacy alias guard, native-config boundary |
| AC-002.1/.2/.3/.4 | Lifecycle `mcp_session_exclusions_test.go`: `TestSessionMCPExclusionsLifecycle` covers active turn, idle RPC, restart, failure, overlapping saves, stale generation, and deferred paths |
| AC-002.5 | `setup_comparison_test.go` and `mcp-selection-changes.test.ts`: exclusion/restoration, known empty, disabled intent, unknown baseline, bounds, stale exclusion IDs |
| AC-003.1/.2/.5 | `mcp-session-exclusions.test.tsx`, editor/context tests: explicit action, retained origins, dormant/disabled rows, failed save, conflict reload, session switch, stable refresh |
| AC-003.3/.4 | Rendered desktop/phone tests: drawer/dialog geometry, keyboard/touch outcome, focus return, measured hit areas, long translations |

IDs in the table use the `AC-AGENTS-SESSION-MCP-EXCLUSIONS-` prefix.
Real PostgreSQL tests require a disposable `KANDEV_TEST_POSTGRES_DSN`; an unset
variable produces a skip, not PostgreSQL evidence.

## E2E tests

Add `tests/chat/mcp-session-exclusions.spec.ts` for Chromium and
`tests/chat/mobile-mcp-session-exclusions.spec.ts` for mobile-chrome. Reuse
`fixtures/test-base`, `helpers/mcp-pending-changes.ts`, and the real saved-selection
API. Seed separate disposable definitions/profiles, two repositories, and sibling
sessions. Restore any modified shared fixture state.

1. Exclude a multiply inherited definition during a busy mock turn. Keep origins
   visible, inspect pending removal, reload, and verify the sibling is unchanged.
   After idle, verify accepted setup and restoration. Covers AC-001.1/.2/.3 and
   AC-002.1/.2/.3/.5, AC-003.1/.2.
2. Exclude a disabled definition, re-enable upstream, and verify exclusion persists.
   Remove its contributors, restore the dormant exception, and verify no new
   positive selection. Covers AC-001.4/.5.
3. Exercise local save rejection, 409 conflict, failed application/retry, next-start
   deferral, and unknown comparison. Presentation injection is allowed for failure
   labels, but lifecycle tests must prove provider semantics. Covers AC-001.6,
   AC-002.4/.5 and AC-003.5.
4. Repeat primary exclusion/restoration by touch and keyboard. Check 320px,
   canonical phone, 767px fine pointer, 768px boundary, and 900px coarse pointer.
   Inspect one scroller, final-row reachability, focus return, and light/dark/pseudo
   wrapping. Covers AC-003.3/.4/.5.

Run changed desktop and mobile specs with existing MCP selection and pending-change
neighbors. Do not overlap E2E runs. Managed runners own isolated runtime ports.
Never use main :9998 or historical :48593/:48595 fixtures.

## Work orders

- [x] [Task 01: Persist and resolve session exclusions](task-01-persist-and-resolve.md)
- [x] [Task 02: Preserve application and recovery truth](task-02-application-recovery.md)
- [x] [Task 03: Expose responsive exclusion controls](task-03-responsive-controls.md)

Dependency order: committed assignment work order 01 -> local 01 -> 02 -> 03.
Reverify the integrated primitive and parent tip before implementation. This is
a source dependency, not permission to implement or to merge a sibling PR.
All three work orders passed their task-defined focused checks after integration
of assignment commit `f9137074309bebe99e2c7576baefe936bc20358f`.

## Documentation impact

Task 03 updates the MCP selection
how-to section in `docs/public/agents-and-profiles.md` with scope, persistence,
restore, disabled definitions, timing, failure, and native/built-in limits.
Inspect `sessions-and-review.md`, `feature-status.md`, root README, and screenshots
for contradictory claims. Do not fabricate new screenshots.

At implementation completion, reconcile the parent requirement clauses listed
in the new requirement, parent selection/pending designs, and the original ADR.
Keep additive ownership and historical parent plan/test receipts intact. Promote
the new requirement/design only when all three work orders pass.

## Verification results

Design validation on 2026-10-22:

- `python3 scripts/list-docs.py validate`: passed, including both new specifications.
- `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.py --all`: passed.
- `python3 scripts/lint-spec-files.test.py`: passed, 36 tests.
- `validateCoverage` from `.github/scripts/pr-docs.cjs`: actual docs-only changes
  are exempt. A preflight using the six documents and an anticipated
  `mcpconfig/selections.go` change returned covered for all three work orders,
  with no reference errors. This is a package-contract check, not a code diff.
- `git diff --check -- docs/specs docs/plans/session-mcp-exclusions`: passed.
  Each untracked file also passed `git diff --no-index --check /dev/null <file>`.
- Local Markdown target checks passed for all six new files.

Coordination revision on 2026-10-22: assignment work order 01 owns the shared
conditional-write primitive. This package consumes its committed result. The
session revision remains existing desired revision; Retry retains same-set
application semantics. Catalog validation and specification lint passed again
after this reconciliation. All six files passed local-link and whitespace checks;
the documentation-coverage preflight remains covered for all three work orders.

At that design checkpoint, product implementation and runtime tests had not run.
The records below supersede that historical status.

## Risks

- A shared handler can accidentally clear E when an older client saves additions.
- Removing origins too early can let legacy fallback reintroduce an excluded server.
- Partial provider acceptance can make a rollback claim false despite retained baseline.
- Exclusion-only sessions can escape cleanup that searches positive associations.
- Sibling edits can overlap shared selection types, copy, and parent documents.


## Implementation verification: 2026-10-23

- Backend selection, setup, exclusion, cleanup, and lifecycle suites passed with race detection.
- Real PostgreSQL mixed writers admitted one revision and rejected its stale competitor; SQLite disk reopen preserved effective suppression and restored delivery eligibility.
- SQLguard and settings-store conformance passed. Changed-Go lint passed with zero issues.
- Frontend focused suites passed: 59 cases across eight files, plus the final hook rerun after a complexity-only refactor.
- Typecheck, changed-file ESLint with zero warnings, i18n completeness, and the new-copy ratchet passed.
- Managed desktop and neighbor browser suites: 13 passed. Managed phone and neighbor suites: 9 passed. Runs were sequential and used isolated fixtures.
- Public documentation validators passed (63 validator tests, 54 pages); specification catalog/lint and whitespace checks passed.

The initial broad resolver run hit a fixture portability failure in
`TestExecNativeMCPCommandRunnerBoundsInheritedPipeAfterCancellation`: its explicit
`/usr/bin:/bin` PATH lacked `sleep` on this Nix host. A separate one-line test fix
preserves the host PATH. The exact required broad command then passed under race
for mcpconfig, settings/store, and settings/handlers. Production runner behavior
is unchanged. Mock providers do not establish live-provider health, immediate
tool revocation, or native-config removal. No merge, parent-branch change,
additional session, or worker occurred.

Implementation refinement: exclusion actions display committed choices only and
require a repeated explicit action after Reload choices. Addition drafts retain
the prerequisite controller's behavior. Pending comparison uses committed IDs
rather than the retained draft, so rejected writes cannot hide saved changes.

Public docs type: how-to. Updated `docs/public/agents-and-profiles.md`; root README,
feature-status/session guides, and screenshot catalog needed no changed instructions.
The parent verification ledger remains historical and untouched.


## Local stack rebase: 2026-10-24

The coordinating session requested the exclusions step after assignment completed
its authorized rebase. The worktree was clean. Before rewriting, created
`backup/session-exclusions-pre-assignment-rebase-20261024` at
`442e9f01f77bd091f9d12d8867fa027bc74cf83e`.

Rebased only commits after OLD prerequisite
`f9137074309bebe99e2c7576baefe936bc20358f` onto verified assignment tip
`9c9abfb13b351ced2869185eb1e730f682e30637`, which contains parent squash
`0b81ae48d4e2c358f80ac489e39388dfd8d7e6ab`. The replacement prerequisite is
`23a403dc2224a668e7f35c60ff5892952608fd3b`; range-diff confirmed its patch is
identical to the old prerequisite. It was not used as the old range boundary.

Commit mapping:

- `8ef7c8d6980910f61803d87ab5e4d57bb376458e` ->
  `3c88cd7fa833e0a94c6ba28186ce90f1a613c557` (feature).
- `442e9f01f77bd091f9d12d8867fa027bc74cf83e` ->
  `b2670fffad2b8c0566d299ce41a167bd78fcaaac` (retained verification records).

Conflicts were limited to eight settings locale files: preserved both assignment
registration keys and exclusion keys. Range-diff shows no other feature patch
change. The PATH portability fix already exists in assignment commit `c49beff60`;
Git omitted that redundant hunk and retained both exclusion verification records.
Committed-positive-ID comparison and neighboring E2E helper corrections are
unchanged. No sibling branch, remote history, or runtime was modified.

Rebase validation:

- Refreshed workspace dependencies with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
- Backend conditional writes, exclusions, resolver, handlers, and application
  integration passed under race detection:
  `go test -trimpath -race ./internal/agent/mcpconfig ./internal/agent/settings/store ./internal/agent/settings/handlers ./internal/backendapp -run 'MCP|Selection|Effective' -count=1`.
- Lifecycle acceptance/defer/retry regressions passed:
  `go test -trimpath -race ./internal/agent/runtime/lifecycle -run 'MCP|Mcp' -count=1`.
- Actual disposable PostgreSQL 17.11 passed under race detection, not skipped:
  `go test -trimpath -race ./internal/agent/settings/store -run 'PostgresMCPSessionExclusions|PostgresMCPSelection|PostgresMCPResolution|PostgresConfirmedMCPDelete' -count=1 -v`.
  This includes concurrent positive/exclusion writers, legacy omission preserving
  exclusions, reopen, cleanup, owner-scoped CAS, import, and deletion.
- Ten frontend suites passed, 68 tests: the original eight focused exclusion
  suites plus registration completion and definition-form integration tests.
- `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run i18n:check`, and `pnpm run i18n:ratchet` passed.
- Fresh managed desktop build and browser regressions passed, 13 cases:
  `pnpm e2e:run --host --project chromium tests/chat/mcp-session-exclusions.spec.ts tests/chat/mcp-pending-changes.spec.ts tests/task/task-mcp-selection.spec.ts`.
  Log: `/tmp/kandev-run.e2e.Lhc5dbMZ.log`.
- Phone browser regressions passed, 9 cases, sequentially against that fresh build:
  `pnpm e2e:run --host --no-build --project mobile-chrome tests/chat/mobile-mcp-session-exclusions.spec.ts tests/chat/mobile-mcp-pending-changes.spec.ts tests/task/mobile-task-mcp-selection.spec.ts`.
  Log: `/tmp/kandev-run.e2e.ioZDYK52.log`.
- Specification catalog (403 decisions, 1732 specifications), full spec lint,
  and whitespace checks passed.

Existing work-order results above remain historical evidence. Rebase validation
does not establish live-provider health. Planned PR base remains
`feature/clarify-mcp-assignme-mhh`. No push or merge is authorized by this step.


## Draft publication stack: 2026-10-24

The coordinator relayed the user's updated publication request: all four MCP
follow-ups publish draft checkpoints, without CI/review waiting or handling.
The current stack is main -> `feature/improve-mcp-manageme-mpe` ->
`feature/clarify-mcp-assignme-mhh` -> `feature/allow-session-only-i-2gn`.
The exclusions PR targets assignment, not main. Management remains a design
checkpoint; assignment WO03 still awaits management navigation. This draft does
not claim those sibling work orders are complete. Exclusions WO01/02/03 are
implemented and retain their completed results.

Verified remote assignment head:
`6faaa61b817dc9dddc60d2c12026cc1273748a13` (draft PR #4760), on management
`f7bbe6076477eebace8740a42adb206e7229e3e4` (draft PR #4759).
Backup `backup/exclusions-pre-publication-stack-20261024` preserves
`70bc5b29ee07cec8dae3db5e792f2826e864be3a`. Replayed only exclusions-owned
commits after OLD assignment cut point `9c9abfb13b351ced2869185eb1e730f682e30637`
onto the new assignment head. No conflicts occurred; range-diff shows all three
patches unchanged:

- `3c88cd7fa833e0a94c6ba28186ce90f1a613c557` ->
  `8deeb1d125fa8b5ad91be7568b1317c42162af77`.
- `b2670fffad2b8c0566d299ce41a167bd78fcaaac` ->
  `8822bfaf2f0c4320ce26b4d6fddb29ef1fe81236`.
- `70bc5b29ee07cec8dae3db5e792f2826e864be3a` ->
  `20b498ed916c99ecfa35af14aab82d8170ef0c4d`.

Committed-positive-ID comparisons, exclusion-preserving conditional writes, and
neighbor E2E helper corrections are unchanged. No sibling branch was mutated.
The manual test instance at port 48671 was shut down at the user's request;
the main instance at port 9998 was untouched.

Post-stack validation:

- `go test -trimpath -race ./internal/agent/mcpconfig ./internal/agent/settings/store ./internal/agent/settings/handlers ./internal/backendapp -run 'MCP|Selection|Effective' -count=1`: passed.
- Actual disposable PostgreSQL 17.11 selection/exclusion concurrency,
  resolution, import/deletion, and cleanup checks under race detection: passed.
- Ten focused frontend suites: 68 tests passed. Typecheck and i18n checks passed.
- Fresh managed desktop build and regressions, including desktop/phone screenshot
  capture: 14 passed (`/tmp/kandev-run.e2e.0hXF3dVv.log`). Capture assets were
  inspected and compressed. The temporary capture spec was removed.
- Phone regressions passed: 9 cases, sequentially against the same build
  (`/tmp/kandev-run.e2e.M7qzBerK.log`).
- Documentation catalog (403 decisions, 1738 specifications), full spec lint,
  and whitespace checks passed.

Unchanged-source lifecycle, SQLguard, store-conformance, lint, and localization
ratchet receipts remain recorded in the earlier work-order results; those broad
checks were not repeated solely for this conflict-free rebase. Mock fixtures do
not establish live-provider health. The final remote SHA and draft URL are
recorded in the saved task plan and coordinator handoff after publication.
No CI watcher, reviewer request, auto-merge, or merge is part of this checkpoint.


## Assignment completion integration: 2026-10-25

The coordinator authorized routine integration after assignment work order 03.
Verified the published assignment branch at
`fe08307e9f4701715e9fc906b1d65916c18971e1`, based on management
`45e90466378f982e13cc762c52432f14ab43c32c`. Assignment reports all its work
orders complete. The earlier pending-work descriptions above are historical.
The PR remains draft #4761 targeting `feature/clarify-mcp-assignme-mhh`.

The clean original tip `69be161548702b4be530536f925777da628302e0` is preserved
by `backup/exclusions-pre-assignment-wo03-20261025`. Replayed only the four
exclusion-owned commits after OLD assignment
`6faaa61b817dc9dddc60d2c12026cc1273748a13` onto the verified replacement:

- `8deeb1d125fa8b5ad91be7568b1317c42162af77` ->
  `ecf6743c2a664ce436fd667bbab74b2e5d33912d`.
- `8822bfaf2f0c4320ce26b4d6fddb29ef1fe81236` ->
  `80f0ba5f04d08c8e8427ce3a9915f9f28a8e9bab`.
- `20b498ed916c99ecfa35af14aab82d8170ef0c4d` ->
  `64411a07c0de2f19dbcda1e6c315f6be8461e1d9`.
- `69be161548702b4be530536f925777da628302e0` ->
  `d7c38c3df8c1fa24917ac47d683fd04e6ea9cd18`.

Resolved shared response, hook, selector, and locale conflicts by preserving
both contracts: profile legacy-import status, assignment route hints and explicit
Customize activation, session origins, exclusions, and saved-versus-applied
comparison. Assignment now owns the identical committed-positive-ID correction
and both neighboring E2E helper corrections; these remain present once and no
longer appear in the exclusions diff. Range-diff shows the other three replayed
commits unchanged. No parent or sibling commits were replayed.

Combined UI code exceeded the existing function length/complexity limits.
Extracted the row annotation into the existing exclusions module, combined the
identical exclusion capability guards, and destructured the accepted selection
snapshot once. Existing behavior tests passed before and after this refactor;
no behavior or new product scope was introduced.

Affected checks:

- MCP/selection/effective Go suites passed under race detection in mcpconfig,
  settings/store, settings/handlers, and backendapp. This includes the new
  assignment eligibility contract and exclusions on the integrated source.
- Actual disposable PostgreSQL 17.11 concurrent selection/exclusion writers,
  owner conditions, resolution snapshots, import/deletion, and cleanup passed
  under race detection. Receipt: `/tmp/exclusions-wo03-postgres.log`.
- Eight focused frontend suites passed (66 tests); after the refactor, the
  session hook, rendered exclusions, and context-switch suites passed (18 tests).
- Typecheck, i18n completeness, changed frontend lint with zero warnings, and
  changed handler Go lint with zero issues passed.
- Specification catalog (403 decisions, 1738 specifications), full spec lint,
  and whitespace checks passed.

The first managed browser attempt completed the fresh build but inherited the
previous preview's Tailscale bind address. Fixture startup failed before browser
assertions. The owned process group was stopped; the wrapper's zero exit without
a summary is not a passing test receipt. Reused that fresh build with the existing
isolated browser library path and explicit loopback bind. Initial log:
`/tmp/kandev-run.e2e.kYD7CBJ1.log`. Main port 9998 was not changed.

Browser integration passed on the fresh build, sequentially, with one worker
and retries disabled:

- Desktop: 22 passed (`/tmp/kandev-run.e2e.QCr4CCVz.log`), covering exclusions,
  pending changes, task selection, assignment handoff, and the capture scenario.
- Phone: 17 passed (`/tmp/kandev-run.e2e.XhxN3AA8.log`), covering exclusions,
  pending changes, task selection, and assignment handoff.

Commands used the managed host runner with `--no-build` only after the completed
fresh build above. The final source was unchanged between those runs. Existing
lifecycle and SQLguard/store-conformance receipts remain applicable to unchanged
source; no full suite, CI waiter, or review handling was added.

Fresh desktop and phone screenshot assets were then captured with
`CAPTURE_PR_ASSETS=1` in a dedicated one-case managed run, passed without retries
(`/tmp/kandev-run.e2e.rlWdhyZC.log`). Both manifest entries were checked against
this run, compressed, and visually inspected. The disposable capture spec was
removed. The images show the final integrated source; later changes are this
verification record only. The full hook receipt and final remote SHA are recorded
in the saved task plan and coordinator handoff after publication.


## Inline profile dependency integration: 2026-10-25

Verified assignment remote `f3be6a5186f43dcce4487371c7a493be6c9ec280`, containing
management `7aca966a6ec262eb1ce839fa883f66e23441d477`. This dependency update
makes profile choices inline and adapts the assignment focus hint. The session
still requires an explicit Customize action. No new exclusion scope was added.

Preserved the clean published exclusions tip
`9d5a5250c9b8a0eca92842f61fce0a32071f0124` as
`backup/exclusions-pre-inline-profile-20261025`. Replayed only own commits after
OLD assignment `fe08307e9f4701715e9fc906b1d65916c18971e1` onto the new tip.
No conflicts occurred; range-diff marks all five patches identical:

- `ecf6743c2a664ce436fd667bbab74b2e5d33912d` ->
  `8f67dd5a3f833fef7c6e3c78bac22d0226a62f6e`.
- `80f0ba5f04d08c8e8427ce3a9915f9f28a8e9bab` ->
  `f463e7ae99f7c995d0d80a51ab0a07c8c3cf16dc`.
- `64411a07c0de2f19dbcda1e6c315f6be8461e1d9` ->
  `8a107656e3e1e01534b1b51467075aae32850e83`.
- `d7c38c3df8c1fa24917ac47d683fd04e6ea9cd18` ->
  `2db5889451b5b5afd781b531277ba77d8f30138e`.
- `9d5a5250c9b8a0eca92842f61fce0a32071f0124` ->
  `2925ed62fd7e7eabd68d0bebe986cde1ac34cdfe`.

The backend, session hook/selector, and explorer source are byte-identical to
the previous verified publication. Existing race/PostgreSQL/lifecycle receipts
remain applicable; they were not rerun for this frontend-only dependency update.
The shared picker change removes an obsolete reveal effect from its wrapper;
the session uses the unchanged content component. Current exclusions screenshots
still show the unchanged surface. Profile UI evidence belongs to the prerequisite
PRs; no unrelated profile screenshot replaces the exclusions evidence.

Focused integration validation:

- Six frontend suites passed, 29 tests: shared picker, exclusion component,
  session hook, assignment focus, settings draft, and profile configuration.
- Full web typecheck passed. Specification catalog and full spec lint passed.
- Fresh managed desktop build and four relevant browser journeys passed with
  one worker and retries disabled (`/tmp/kandev-run.e2e.Md4DCfB7.log`): exclusion
  restore, global profile assignment, workspace-owned profile assignment, and
  explicit session Customize handoff.

- The same four journeys passed on phone, sequentially against that fresh build,
  with one worker and retries disabled (`/tmp/kandev-run.e2e.F0XVo080.log`).

Only this integration record was added after checks. Normal hook receipt and
final local/remote/PR SHA are recorded in the saved task plan and coordinator
handoff. PR #4761 remains draft on assignment. No CI/review handling, merge,
sibling edits, new agents, or runtime changes are part of this update.

## Management squash integration: 2026-10-26

Verified assignment remote `7604e81b0446062a5600f07857062380d0a1c587` contains
actual management squash `e5c38184cf9c191075dc88c1ffad28c636858bf5` on main.
Management PR #4759 is merged; assignment PR #4760 now targets main. Exclusions
PR #4761 continues to target the assignment branch and remains draft.

Preserved the clean published exclusions tip
`77a3e83a6445c8a53066fdf8a7c3d0caac4ccbee` as
`backup/exclusions-pre-management-squash-20261026`. Replayed only own six commits
after OLD assignment `f3be6a5186f43dcce4487371c7a493be6c9ec280` onto the new
assignment head. The resulting range contains only these exclusion-owned commits;
no management or assignment commit was replayed:

- `8f67dd5a3f833fef7c6e3c78bac22d0226a62f6e` ->
  `8b537c513b2480269b61d3ea8edeb0ca96ce5fe6`.

Conflicts were limited to appended task-locale keys in eight catalogs. Preserved
both the new main question-image keys and the session-exclusion reason. Range-diff
shows only the changed neighboring locale context in the feature patch; the other
five replayed patches are identical. The shared settings draft hook and its
suspended-render test are byte-identical to assignment, including the layout-effect
ref publication and expected_definition_ids assertion. Inline profile hint readiness
and explicit session Customize behavior remain intact.

The MCP resolver/store/handler code and session exclusion UI are byte-identical
to the prior publication. Existing PostgreSQL concurrency, lifecycle, SQLguard,
store-conformance and session screenshots remain applicable; the main/base update
does not change the screenshot's user-visible exclusion surface. No new product
implementation was needed.

Affected checks completed on the integrated source:

- `go test -trimpath -race ./internal/agent/mcpconfig ./internal/agent/settings/store ./internal/agent/settings/handlers ./internal/backendapp -run 'MCP|Selection|Effective' -count=1`: passed, including application wiring on the merged main baseline.
- Eleven focused frontend suites passed, 91 tests. This includes selection
  editor/context, settings draft, assignment focus, session exclusion rendering,
  pending comparison, API, and task-route admission tests.
- Full web typecheck and i18n completeness passed. All eight merged task catalogs
  retained the upstream question-image keys and exclusion reason.
- Catalog validation (403 decisions, 1744 specifications), full spec lint, and
  whitespace checks passed.
- Fresh managed desktop build and 21 focused Chromium E2E cases passed with
  zero retries; log `/tmp/kandev-run.e2e.92U49Np8.log`.
- The same build passed 17 mobile Chrome E2E cases with zero retries; log
  `/tmp/kandev-run.e2e.FEoGoO2J.log`. Both runs covered exclusion/restore,
  committed-versus-pending changes, task origins, assignment handoff, and error
  recovery. Desktop additionally covered narrow fine-pointer and coarse-pointer
  tablet paths. Runs were sequential, with one worker each.

Only this integration record changed after validation. Normal commit-hook receipt
and the final local/remote/PR SHA are recorded in the saved task plan and coordinator
handoff. Publish with the captured exact exclusions remote-OID lease. PR #4761
remains draft on assignment; the next replay boundary is
`7604e81b0446062a5600f07857062380d0a1c587`. No CI/review handling, merge, sibling
edits, new agents, or main runtime changes are part of this update.
